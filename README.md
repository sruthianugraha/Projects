A knowledge graph is a data structure that represents a collection of interconnected information about various concepts and entities. It is a graphical representation of relationships between different pieces of information, such as people, places, events, and objects. Knowledge graphs are used to model complex real-world data and to enable computers to understand and process the meaning of the data. They are often used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications to enable machines to understand and interpret human language.
