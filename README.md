# knowledge graph

A knowledge graph is a data structure that represents a collection of interconnected information about various concepts and entities. It is a graphical representation of relationships between different pieces of information, such as people, places, events, and objects. Knowledge graphs are used to model complex real-world data and to enable computers to understand and process the meaning of the data. They are often used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications to enable machines to understand and interpret human language.
Different Techniques used in Knowledge Graphs
There are many different techniques that can be used in knowledge graphs, depending on the specific application and the needs of the user. Some common techniques include:
\item Entity linking: Entity linking is the process of identifying and disambiguating the entities mentioned in a text or document, and linking them to the corresponding entries in a knowledge graph.
    \item Graph embedding: Graph embedding is a technique that represents the nodes and edges in a knowledge graph as low-dimensional vectors, which can be used for tasks such as information retrieval, recommendation, and classification.
    \item Graph convolutional networks: Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are a type of neural network that is specifically designed to operate on graph-structured data. GCN can be used to learn features from knowledge graphs and perform tasks such as node classification and link prediction.
    
    Graph embedding}
 Graph embedding is a technique that represents the nodes and edges in a knowledge graph as low-dimensional vectors. The goal of graph embedding is to learn a continuous and low-dimensional representation of the nodes in a graph, in such a way that nodes that are similar in the graph are close in the embedding space. This makes it possible to perform tasks such as information retrieval, recommendation, and classification on the graph using standard machine learning techniques.
