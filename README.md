A knowledge graph is a data structure that represents a collection of interconnected information about various concepts and entities. It is a graphical representation of relationships between different pieces of in\item Knowledge Graph is a concept emerging as a pillar for managing the data efficiently
        * Knowledge Graph used in the area of semantic web in late 90's
        * Which is easy to interpret by both humans and machines
        * Knowledge Graph can control data management and control management through new level of efficiency
        * One of its pillars are ontologiesformation, such as people, places, events, and objects. Knowledge graphs are used to model complex real-world data and to enable computers to understand and process the meaning of the data. They are often used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications to enable machines to understand and interpret human language.
